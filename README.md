## Introduction
This application shows the list of in-season sports, upcoming events, and odds. It was built using the [Sports Betting API](https://the-odds-api.com/) based on the *Clean Architecture-MVVM* structure.

### :grey_question: What is Clean Architecture & MVVM
- MVVM is a design pattern that is built up of a *Model* which represents the data, a *View* that is the UI, and a *ViewModel* that links the data and the UI of the application.
- Clean Architecture is a philosophy in software that separates the code into different modules and sections with specific responsibilities via the use of layers (Entities, Use Cases, Interface Adapters, and Framework & Drivers).
